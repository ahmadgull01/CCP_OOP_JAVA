1. Introduction
This project is about helping students manage their mental well-being. It uses Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) to create a simple support system where students can access mental health tips, report issues, or reach out for help. The goal is to provide a digital solution for improving student well-being.
2. Objective
•	To help students feel supported during stressful times.
•	To give motivational and mental health tips.
•	To demonstrate OOP principles in a real-life scenario.
•	To use terminal colors to improve the user experience.
3. Technologies and Tools
Technology	Description
Java	Main programming language
OOP Concepts	Classes, Objects, Inheritance, etc.
ANSI Color Codes	For colorful and readable terminal output
4. Core OOP Concepts Used
Classes & Objects
Each part of the system is designed as a class, such as:
Student Support
•	Tips
•	Colors
These are real-life entities turned into code.
Encapsulation
Data like messages and methods are protected inside each class and accessed only when needed using proper methods.
Inheritance
Also implemented the core concept of inheritance in which certain classes are extended from main base/parent class to show the implementation of inheritance.
Polymorphism
The same method name is used to show different messages based on the user's choices (e.g., different tip suggestions/categories).
Abstraction
Complex functionality (like printing colorful tips or handling user choices) is hidden inside easy-to-call methods.
5. Use of Color
The addition of the Colors class adds a new layer of user-friendliness. Instead of plain text, different messages appear in different colors to:
•	Show greetings in bold cyan
•	Display tips in green
•	Warn user in red (e.g., invalid input)
•	Highlight menus in blue or yellow
This makes the interface more readable and lively, even though it’s console-based.
6. Challenges Faced
•	Applying color in a clean way without breaking formatting.
•	Structuring the logic so different classes remain independent.
•	Making the system feel user-friendly even without a GUI.
7. Future Enhancements
Here are some simple and achievable ideas for expanding this project:
Feature	Description
 Login System	Allow students to log in securely before accessing features.
 GUI or Mobile App	Build a front-end using Java Swing or Android.
 Chatbot Integration	Add a simple bot that replies with motivational quotes or advice.
 User Progress Tracker	Track how many times users accessed tips or support.
 Online Resource Linking	Add links to actual websites for real mental health support.
8. Conclusion
This project shows how Java and OOP can be used to create meaningful, helpful systems—even with a simple console-based interface. The added colors make it more readable and user-friendly. It’s a good example of using programming to support real-world mental health needs in a creative way.
